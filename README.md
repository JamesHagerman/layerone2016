# layerone2016

layerone2016 eagle and badge firmware

Needs 
  PSoC Creator  3.3 SP2 (3.3.0.9604)
  First build will generate all the generated code and so on, different versions of PSOC will need the boot hex path updated in the config
  
LayerOne2015 firmware is similar.

lights_servers is my hackpad VC20015 project for windows (see L12015 for other OS's) it sends out the UDP packets for different sized strips and can also do an audio visualiser with BASS http://www.un4seen.com/
